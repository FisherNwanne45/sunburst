Second quarter 2017 results include a $1.9 million reversal of provision for loan losses which accounted for $0.04 of the quarter\u2019s EPS. First quarter 2017 results reflect the Company\u2019s prospective adoption of a new accounting standard related to share based compensation tax benefits; first quarter 2017 EPS measured $0.02 higher than would have been measured under accounting standards applied in 2016. The new accounting standard did not affect second quarter 2017 results by a meaningful amount.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Second quarter 2017 net income benefited from higher noninterest income and lower noninterest expense. While short-term market interest rates rose during the second quarter 2017, intermediate and long-term rates declined; the interest rate environment was not conducive for net interest margin improvement. Credit quality improved with non-performing assets declining $650 thousand during the second quarter 2017 to total $8.5 million at June 30, 2017,\u201d said Chairman, President and CEO David Payne. \u201cWestamerica generated an annualized 10.7 percent return on average shareholders\u2019 common equity for the second quarter 2017, and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per common share,\u201d concluded Payne.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The annualized net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 3.12 percent for the second quarter 2017, compared to 3.14 percent for the first quarter 2017, and 3.27 percent for the second quarter 2016. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $35.8 million for the second quarter 2017, compared to $36.0 million for the first quarter 2017, and $36.5 million for the second quarter 2016. The annualized funding cost of deposits and other interest-bearing borrowings, as a percentage of average earning assets, was 0.04 percent for the second quarter 2017, compared to 0.04 percent for the first quarter 2017 and 0.05 percent for the second quarter 2016. Checking and savings deposits, which earn relatively low interest rates and are less volatile than time deposits during periods of rising market interest rates, represented 95 percent of average total deposits during the second quarter 2017.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Company recognized a reversal of provision for loan losses of $1.9 million for the second quarter 2017; during the quarter the Company realized net recoveries of prior loan losses of $1.1 million and nonperforming loans declined $159 thousand, totaling $6.9 million at June 30, 2017. The provision for loan losses was zero for the first quarter 2017 and second quarter 2016. At June 30, 2017, the allowance for loan losses totaled $24.1 million.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noninterest income for the second quarter 2017 totaled $12.1 million, compared to $11.7 million for the first quarter 2017 and $11.7 million for the second quarter 2016. The second quarter 2017 improvement in noninterest income is primarily due to higher merchant processing fees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noninterest expense for the second quarter 2017 totaled $24.4 million, compared to $24.6 million for the first quarter 2017 and $25.2 million for the second quarter 2016. The $800 thousand reduction in noninterest expense from the second quarter 2016 to the second quarter 2017 was due to reductions in professional fees, correspondent service charges, insurance premiums, limited partnership operating losses, intangible amortization, and other expenses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The income tax provision for 2017 reflects the prospective adoption of Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-09, \u201cImprovements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d. Upon granting non-qualified stock options (\u201cNQSO\u201d), the Company estimates the fair value of the grant and records such value as compensation expense over the attribution period in its financial statements. At the time the NQSO grant is exercised, the ultimate value of the grant is determined and represents taxable income to the grantee and a tax deduction for the Company. The difference between the estimated fair value expensed for financial statement purposes and the realized amount deducted for tax purposes requires a reconciling adjustment to the Company\u2019s tax accounts. Prior to ASU 2016-09, the Company recognized the balancing entry as an adjustment to shareholders\u2019 equity; upon the January 1, 2017 required adoption of ASU 2016-09, the Company must recognize the balancing entry as an adjustment to the provision for income taxes. The Company\u2019s fully-tax equivalent tax rate was 37.8 percent for the second quarter 2017, compared to 34.8 percent for the first quarter 2017 and 36.7 percent for the second quarter 2016. The fully-tax equivalent tax rate would have been 37.8 percent for the second quarter 2017 and 37.7 percent for the first quarter 2017 under accounting rules applied in 2016.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At June 30, 2017, Westamerica Bancorporation&#8217;s tangible common equity-to-asset ratio was 8.90 percent, and assets totaled $5.4 billion. Westamerica Bancorporation, through its wholly owned subsidiary Westamerica Bank, operates commercial banking and trust offices throughout Northern and Central California.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/2ndqfinhi17.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Quarterly Financial Highlights&nbsp;<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The following appears in accordance with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This press release may contain forward-looking statements about the Company, including descriptions of plans or objectives of its management for future operations, products or services, and forecasts of its revenues, earnings or other measures of economic performance.
