Third quarter 2018 results include a $585 thousand tax-exempt life insurance policy gain and a $3.5 million loss contingency settlement, which on an aggregate basis reduced EPS $0.07.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Fourth quarter 2018 net interest income demonstrated continuing improvement as higher market interest rates benefit the yields on our interest-earning loans and securities. Our annualized funding costs were unchanged at 0.04 percent of interest-earning assets due to the predominance of low-cost checking and savings accounts in our deposit portfolio. The annualized net interest margin on a fully-taxable equivalent (\u201cFTE\u201d) basis rose from 3.00 percent for the third quarter 2018 to 3.06 percent for the fourth quarter 2018. Asset quality remains solid with nonperforming assets totaling only $5.8 million at December 31, 2018,\u201d said Chairman, President and CEO David Payne. \u201cFourth quarter 2018 results generated an annualized 11.7 percent return on average common equity. These results allowed the Board of Directors to approve a $0.40 per share dividend in the fourth quarter 2018 for our shareholders,\u201d concluded Payne.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Net interest income (FTE) was $40.3 million for the fourth quarter 2018, compared to $39.5 million for the third quarter 2018 and $37.9 million for the fourth quarter 2017. The annualized net interest margin (FTE) was 3.06 percent for the fourth quarter 2018, compared to 3.00 percent for the third quarter 2018 and 2.96 percent for the fourth quarter 2017. Checking and savings deposits, which are less sensitive to rising interest rates than time deposits, represented ninety-six percent of the Company\u2019s average deposit base during the fourth quarter 2018.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Company recognized no provision for loan losses for the fourth quarter 2018 given low levels of nonperforming loans and other credit quality attributes.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter 2018 totaled $25.8 million, compared to $29.4 million for the third quarter 2018 and $31.4 million for the fourth quarter 2017. Noninterest expense for the third quarter 2018 included a $3.5 million loss contingency settlement to dismiss a lawsuit. Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter 2017 included a $5.5 million loss contingency to provide refunds of revenue to some customers. Loss contingencies represent estimated liabilities which are subject to revision.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tax rate (FTE) applied to pre-tax income (FTE) was 27.8 percent for the fourth quarter 2018, compared to 25.0 percent for the third quarter 2018 and 84.5 percent for the fourth quarter 2017. The lower tax rates for 2018 compared to 2017 reflect a reduction in the federal corporate tax rate due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cAct\u201d). The Act was signed into law in the fourth quarter 2017, requiring re-measurement of deferred tax assets which resulted in a $12.3 million charge to the fourth quarter 2017 book tax provision. The book tax provisions for the fourth quarter 2018 and third quarter 2018 include tax benefits of $7 thousand and $152 thousand, respectively, for tax deductions from the exercise of employee stock options which exceed related compensation expense recognized in the financial statements.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Westamerica Bancorporation, through its wholly owned subsidiary Westamerica Bank, operates commercial banking and trust offices throughout Northern and Central California.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Q418-Financial-Highlights.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Quarterly Financial Highlights&nbsp;<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The following appears in accordance with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This press release may contain forward-looking statements about the Company, including descriptions of plans or objectives of its management for future operations, products or services, and forecasts of its revenues, earnings or other measures of economic performance.
