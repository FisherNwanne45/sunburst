Third quarter 2018 results compare to second quarter 2018 net income of $18.0 million and EPS of $0.67, and third quarter 2017 net income of $15.0 million and EPS of $0.57.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Third quarter 2018 net interest income demonstrated continuing improvement as rising market interest rates benefit the yields on our interest earning assets. Our annualized funding costs were unchanged at 0.04 percent of interest-earning assets due to the predominance of low-cost checking and savings accounts in our deposit portfolio. The net interest margin on a fully-taxable equivalent (\u201cFTE\u201d) basis rose from 3.08 percent in the second quarter 2018 to 3.10 percent in the third quarter 2018. Asset quality remains solid with nonperforming assets totaling only $6.5 million at September 30, 2018, and net loan losses of $1 million for the first nine months of 2018,\u201d said Chairman, President and CEO David Payne. \u201cThird quarter 2018 results generated an annualized 10.6 percent return on average common equity. These consistent operating results allowed the Board of Directors to approve a $0.40 per share dividend in the third quarter 2018, totaling $10.7 million, for our shareholders\u201d concluded Payne.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Net interest income (FTE) was $37.1 million for the third quarter 2018, compared to $36.6 million for the second quarter 2018 and $35.7 million for the third quarter 2017. The net interest margin (FTE) was 3.10 percent for the third quarter 2018, compared to 3.08 percent for the second quarter 2018 and 3.10 percent for the third quarter 2017. Checking and savings deposits, which are less sensitive to rising interest rates than time deposits, represented ninety-six percent of the Company\u2019s average deposit base during the third quarter 2018.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Company recognized no provision for loan losses for the third quarter 2018 given stable nonperforming loan volumes and other credit quality attributes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noninterest income for the third quarter 2018 totaled $12.5 million, compared to $11.8 million for the second quarter 2018 and $12.5 million for the third quarter 2017. Noninterest income for the third quarter 2018 included a tax-exempt life insurance policy gain of $585 thousand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noninterest expense for the third quarter 2018 totaled $27.0 million, compared to $24.0 million for the second quarter 2018 and $24.1 million for the third quarter 2017. Noninterest expense for the third quarter 2018 included a $3.5 million contingency settlement as the Company achieved a mediated settlement to dismiss a lawsuit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tax rate (FTE) applied to pre-tax income (FTE) was 25.0 percent for the third quarter 2018, compared to 26.1 percent for the second quarter 2018 and 37.7 percent for the third quarter 2017. The lower tax rates for 2018 compared to 2017 reflect a reduction in the federal corporate tax rate due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The book tax provisions for the third quarter 2018 and the second quarter 2018 include tax benefits of $152 thousand and $128 thousand, respectively, for tax deductions from the exercise of employee stock options which exceed related compensation expense recognized in the financial statements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Westamerica Bancorporation, through its wholly owned subsidiary Westamerica Bank, operates commercial banking and trust offices throughout Northern and Central California.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/3rdqfinhi18.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Quarterly Financial Highlights&nbsp;<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The following appears in accordance with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This press release may contain forward-looking statements about the Company, including descriptions of plans or objectives of its management for future operations, products or services, and forecasts of its revenues, earnings or other measures of economic performance.
