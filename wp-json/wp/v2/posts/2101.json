This growth in lower-costing deposit products supported our 3.34 percent net interest margin in the first quarter 2016. Westamerica\u2019s credit quality remained relatively stable at healthy levels throughout the first quarter 2016, requiring no provision for loan losses. Our operating expenses were affected by seasonally high payroll taxes in the first quarter 2016, but represented only 54 percent of our revenues,\u201d said Chairman, President and CEO David Payne. \u201cOur operating results generated an annualized return on shareholders\u2019 common equity of 11 percent for the first quarter 2016, and Westamerica paid its shareholders a $0.39 per share quarterly dividend,\u201d concluded Payne.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The annualized net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 3.34 percent for the first quarter 2016, compared to 3.32 percent for the prior quarter, and 3.43 percent for the first quarter 2015. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $36.4 million for the first quarter 2016, compared to $36.7 million for the prior quarter, and $36.9 million for the first quarter 2015. The Company\u2019s loan portfolio has declined from the first quarter 2015 through the first quarter 2016; Management has been avoiding long-dated, low-yielding loans given historically low interest rates. Management has also maintained conservative loan underwriting, terms and conditions. During this period, the investment portfolio has grown. The changing composition of interest earning assets and low market interest rates has pressured the net interest margin. The increase in the net interest margin from the fourth quarter 2015 to the first quarter 2016 reflects the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s 0.25 percent increase in the federal funds rate on December 16, 2015, which increased yields on loans and investment securities which have floating rates. The funding cost of deposits and other interest-bearing borrowings, as a percentage of average loans and investment securities, was 0.05 percent for the first quarter 2016, unchanged from the prior quarter and down from 0.06 percent for the first quarter 2015.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The provision for loan losses was zero for the first quarter 2016, unchanged from the prior quarter and first quarter 2015. Net loan losses charged against the allowance for loan losses totaled $284 thousand for the first quarter 2016, compared to $265 thousand for the prior quarter and $298 thousand for the first quarter 2015. At March 31, 2016, the allowance for loan losses totaled $29.5 million and nonperforming loans totaled $18.0 million.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noninterest income for the first quarter 2016 totaled $11.7 million, compared to $11.3 million for the prior quarter, and $12.3 million for the first quarter 2015.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noninterest expense for the first quarter 2016 totaled $25.9 million, compared to $25.5 million for the prior quarter, and $26.7 million for the first quarter 2015.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At March 31, 2016, Westamerica Bancorporation&#8217;s tangible common equity-to-asset ratio was 8.0 percent, and assets totaled $5.2 billion. Westamerica Bancorporation, through its wholly owned subsidiary Westamerica Bank, operates commercial banking and trust offices throughout Northern and Central California.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/1stqfinhi16.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Quarterly Financial Highlights&nbsp;<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The following appears in accordance with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This press release may contain forward-looking statements about the Company, including descriptions of plans or objectives of its management for future operations, products or services, and forecasts of its revenues, earnings or other measures of economic performance.
