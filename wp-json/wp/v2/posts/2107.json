Lower-cost checking and savings deposits continued to grow in the fourth quarter 2015, and represented 94 percent of total deposits at December 31, 2015. Westamerica\u2019s credit quality remained stable at healthy levels throughout the fourth quarter 2015, requiring no provision for loan losses, and our operating expenses represented only 53 percent of our revenues during the quarter,\u201d said Chairman, President and CEO David Payne. \u201cOur operating results generated an annualized return on shareholders\u2019 common equity of 11 percent for the fourth quarter 2015, and Westamerica increased its quarterly shareholder dividend to $0.39 per share,\u201d concluded Payne.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The annualized net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 3.32 percent for the fourth quarter 2015, compared to 3.31 percent for the prior quarter and 3.53 percent for the fourth quarter 2014. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $36.7 million for the fourth quarter 2015, compared to $37.2 million for the prior quarter, and $37.3 million for the fourth quarter 2014. The yields on the Company\u2019s interest earning loans and investment securities were pressured by low market interest rates during 2015. During this period, the Company avoided long-dated, low-yielding loans given the expectation for rising interest rates; the Company also reduced its exposure to rising interest rates by purchasing shorter-duration investment securities. The funding cost of deposits and other interest-bearing borrowings, as a percentage of average loans and investment securities, was 0.05 percent for the fourth quarter 2015, unchanged from the prior quarter and down from 0.08 percent for the fourth quarter 2014.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The provision for loan losses was zero for the fourth quarter 2015, unchanged from the prior quarter, and down from $200 thousand for the fourth quarter 2014. Net loan losses charged against the allowance for loan losses totaled $265 thousand for the fourth quarter 2015, compared to $792 thousand for the prior quarter and $484 thousand for the fourth quarter 2014. At December 31, 2015, the allowance for loan losses totaled $30 million and nonperforming loans totaled $15.3 million.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noninterest income for the fourth quarter 2015 totaled $11.3 million, compared to $12.0 million for the prior quarter, and $12.5 million for the fourth quarter 2014. The decline in noninterest income is due to declines in service charges on deposit accounts and merchant processing fees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter 2015 totaled $25.5 million, compared to $26.2 million for the prior quarter and $26.4 million for the fourth quarter 2014. The decline in noninterest expense is due to declines in personnel costs and other operating expenses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At December 31, 2015, Westamerica Bancorporation&#8217;s tangible common equity-to-asset ratio was 7.9 percent, and assets totaled $5.2 billion. Westamerica Bancorporation, through its wholly owned subsidiary Westamerica Bank, operates commercial banking and trust offices throughout Northern and Central California.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/4thqfinihi2015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Quarterly Financial Highlights&nbsp;<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The following appears in accordance with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This press release may contain forward-looking statements about the Company, including descriptions of plans or objectives of its management for future operations, products or services, and forecasts of its revenues, earnings or other measures of economic performance.
