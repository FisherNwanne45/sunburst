Our annualized funding costs were unchanged, however, at 0.04 percent of interest-earning assets due to the predominance of low-cost checking and savings accounts in our deposit portfolio. Net interest income on a fully-taxable equivalent (\u201cFTE\u201d) basis was $36.6 million for the second quarter 2018, compared to $35.5 million for the first quarter 2018 and $35.8 million for the second quarter 2017. Noninterest expenses for the second quarter 2018 were $24.0 million, compared to $24.2 million for first quarter 2018 and $24.4 million second quarter 2017. The improvement in revenue and decline in operating expenses resulted in pre-tax income equal to 50.4 percent of total revenues for the second quarter 2018,\u201d said Chairman, President and CEO David Payne. \u201cAsset quality remains strong with nonperforming assets totaling only $6 million at June 30, 2018, and net loan loss recoveries of $31 thousand for the first six months of 2018. Second quarter 2018 results generated an annualized 11.6 percent return on average common equity for our shareholders,\u201d concluded Payne.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Net interest income (FTE) was $36.6 million for the second quarter 2018, compared to $35.5 million for the first quarter 2018 and $35.8 million for the second quarter 2017. The net interest margin (FTE) was 3.08 percent for the second quarter 2018, compared to 3.02 percent for the first quarter 2018 and 3.12 percent for the second quarter 2017. Checking and savings deposits, which are less sensitive to rising interest rates than time deposits, represented ninety-five percent of the Company\u2019s average deposit base during the second quarter 2018.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Company recognized no provision for loan losses for the second quarter 2018 given stable nonperforming loan volumes and other credit quality attributes. At June 30, 2018, the allowance for loan losses totaled $23.0 million.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noninterest income for the second quarter 2018 totaled $11.8 million, compared to $12.0 million for the first quarter 2018 and $12.1 million for the second quarter 2017.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noninterest expense for the second quarter 2018 totaled $24.0 million, compared to $24.2 million for the first quarter 2018 and $24.4 million for the second quarter 2017.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tax rate (FTE) applied to pre-tax income was 26.1 percent for the second quarter 2018, compared to 24.6 percent for the first quarter 2018 and 37.8 percent for the second quarter 2017. The lower tax rates for 2018 compared to 2017 reflect a reduction in the federal corporate tax rate due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The book tax provisions for the second quarter 2018 and the first quarter 2018 include tax benefits of $128 thousand and $451 thousand, respectively, for tax deductions from the exercise of employee stock options which exceed related compensation expense recognized in the financial statements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Westamerica Bancorporation, through its wholly owned subsidiary Westamerica Bank, operates commercial banking and trust offices throughout Northern and Central California.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/2ndqfinhi18.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Quarterly Financial Highlights&nbsp;<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The following appears in accordance with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This press release may contain forward-looking statements about the Company, including descriptions of plans or objectives of its management for future operations, products or services, and forecasts of its revenues, earnings or other measures of economic performance.
