These results compare to net income of $19.6 million and EPS of $0.73 for the second quarter 2019 and net income of $17.0 million and EPS of $0.63 for the third quarter 2018.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The annualized net interest margin was 3.11 percent for the third quarter 2019 compared to 3.13 percent for the second quarter 2019. The valuable composition of our deposit base supported the margin; our annualized funding costs as a percentage of our interest-earning assets remained at just 0.04 percent for the third quarter 2019. Operating expense declined to $24.0 million for the third quarter 2019 compared to $25.6 million for the second quarter 2019 and $29.4 million for the third quarter 2018. Operating costs represented only 46 percent of revenues for the third quarter 2019. Asset quality remained solid with nonperforming assets totaling only 4.7 million at September 30, 2019,\u201d said Chairman, President and CEO David Payne. \u201cThird quarter 2019 results generated an annualized 11.9 percent return on average shareholders\u2019 equity, and the Company paid its shareholders a $0.41 dividend per common share in the third quarter,\u201d concluded Payne.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Net interest income on a fully-taxable equivalent (FTE) basis was $40.3 million for the third quarter 2019, compared to $40.3 million for the second quarter 2019 and $39.5 million for the third quarter 2018. The annualized net interest margin (FTE) was 3.11 percent for the third quarter 2019, compared to 3.13 percent for the second quarter 2019 and 3.00 percent for the third quarter 2018. Checking and savings deposits, which pay much lower interest rates than time deposits, represented ninety-six percent of the Company\u2019s average deposit base during the third quarter 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Company recognized no provision for loan losses for the third quarter 2019 given low levels of nonperforming loans and other credit quality attributes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noninterest income for the third quarter 2019 totaled $11.8 million, compared to $12.3 million for the second quarter 2019, and $12.5 million for the third quarter 2018.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noninterest expense for the third quarter 2019 totaled $24.0 million, a decline of $1.5 million from the second quarter 2019 due to lower FDIC insurance assessments and employee benefit costs in the third quarter 2019 and a contingency provision recognized in the second quarter 2019. Noninterest expense for the third quarter 2019 was $5.3 million lower than the third quarter 2018 due to a contingency provision recognized in the third quarter 2018 and lower FDIC insurance assessments, employee benefit costs, and intangible amortization in the third quarter 2019. Lower third quarter 2019 FDIC assessments are due to application of Westamerica Bank\u2019s assessment credit described in our December 31, 2018 Form 10-K, Part 1, Item 1, \u201cPremiums for Deposit Insurance.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tax rate (FTE) applied to pre-tax income (FTE) was 27.5 percent for the third quarter 2019, compared to 27.5 percent for the second quarter 2019 and 25.0 percent for the third quarter 2018. The higher tax rates in the third and second quarters of 2019 are due to lower levels of tax-exempt interest income and stock compensation tax deductions, and a life insurance gain realized in the third quarter 2018.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Westamerica Bancorporation\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary Westamerica Bank, operates commercial banking and trust offices throughout Northern and Central California.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/westamerica.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Q3-19-Financial-Highlights.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Quarterly Financial Highlights<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following appears in accordance with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This press release may contain forward-looking statements about the Company, including descriptions of plans or objectives of its management for future operations, products or services, and forecasts of its revenues, earnings or other measures of economic performance.
