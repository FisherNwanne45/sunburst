Second quarter 2014 results compare to net income of $15.3 million and EPS of $0.58 for the prior quarter, and net income of $17.1 million and EPS of $0.64 for the second quarter 2013.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Westamerica\u2019s credit quality remained sound with nonperforming assets totaling $30 million at June 30, 2014, essentially unchanged from March 31, 2014. Our net loan losses remained below $1 million for the second consecutive quarter reflecting the improved quality of our loan portfolio. Our net interest margin was 3.76 percent in the second quarter, down from 3.83 percent in the prior quarter. Low market interest rates continued to pressure our net interest margin, particularly yields on the investment securities portfolio where we are purchasing shorter-duration, lower-yielding securities to prepare for rising interest rates. We are also focusing on managing our operating costs to efficient levels while providing superior customer service,\u201d said Chairman, President and CEO David Payne. \u201cOur second quarter earnings delivered a relatively high annualized return on common equity of 11.6 percent for our shareholders, and we paid a $0.38 per share dividend during the quarter,\u201d concluded Payne.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (\u201cFTE\u201d) basis was $38.6 million for the second quarter 2014, compared to $38.9 million for the prior quarter and $42.6 million for the second quarter 2013. Net interest income declined as market interest rates on many loan products remain below the yields earned on older-dated loans and on the overall loan portfolio. The Company is reducing its exposure to rising interest rates by purchasing shorter-duration investment securities which carry lower yields than longer-duration securities. The annualized interest cost of funding the Company&#8217;s loans and investment securities was 0.09 percent for the second quarter 2014, unchanged from the prior quarter, and reduced from 0.12 percent for the second quarter 2013. The annualized net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 3.76 percent for the second quarter 2014, compared to 3.83 percent for the prior quarter and 4.12 percent for the second quarter 2013.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The provision for loan losses was $1.0 million for the second quarter 2014, unchanged from $1.0 million for the prior quarter, and reduced from $1.8 million for the second quarter 2013. Net loan losses charged against the allowance for loan losses totaled $711 thousand for the second quarter 2014, compared to $584 thousand for the prior quarter and $1.2 million for the second quarter 2013. At June 30, 2014, the allowance for loan losses totaled $32.4 million; nonperforming originated loans totaled $7.1 million; and nonperforming purchased loans totaled $14.0 million, net of purchase discounts of $471 thousand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noninterest income for the second quarter 2014 totaled $13.2 million, compared to $13.0 million for the prior quarter and $14.3 million for the second quarter 2013. Noninterest income was higher in the second quarter 2013 due to higher service charges on deposit accounts and higher merchant processing service fees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noninterest expense for the second quarter 2014 totaled $27.0 million, compared to $26.9 million in the prior quarter and $28.2 million for the second quarter 2013. Noninterest expense was higher in the second quarter 2013 due to higher professional fees and higher costs related to repossessed loan collateral (\u201cOREO\u201d).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At June 30, 2014, Westamerica Bancorporation&#8217;s tangible common equity-to-asset ratio was 8.4 percent, assets totaled $4.9 billion and loans outstanding totaled $1.8 billion.
