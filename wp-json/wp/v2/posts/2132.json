With this improvement in credit quality, we reduced our loan loss provision to $600 thousand for the third quarter 2014. Our net interest margin was 3.66 percent in the third quarter, down from 3.76 percent in the prior quarter. Low market interest rates continue to pressure our net interest margin, particularly the securities portfolio yield as we purchase shorter-duration, lower-yielding securities to prepare for rising interest rates. We continue to focus on controlling operating costs while providing superior customer service; our third quarter 2014 expenses were down $341 thousand from the prior quarter and down $1.1 million from the third quarter 2013,\u201d said Chairman, President and CEO David Payne. \u201cOur third quarter 2014 earnings delivered a relatively high annualized return on common equity of 11.5 percent for our shareholders, and we paid a $0.38 per share dividend during the quarter,\u201d concluded Payne.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (\u201cFTE\u201d) basis was $37.9 million for the third quarter 2014, compared to $38.6 million for the prior quarter and $41.2 million for the third quarter 2013. Net interest income declined as market interest rates on many loan products remain below the yields earned on older-dated loans and on the overall loan portfolio. The Company is reducing its exposure to rising interest rates by purchasing shorter-duration investment securities which carry lower yields than longer-duration securities. The annualized interest cost of funding the Company&#8217;s loans and investment securities was 0.08 percent for the third quarter 2014, down from 0.09 percent from the prior quarter, and down from 0.11 percent for the third quarter 2013. The annualized net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 3.66 percent for the third quarter 2014, compared to 3.76 percent for the prior quarter and 4.01 percent for the third quarter 2013.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The provision for loan losses was $600 thousand for the third quarter 2014, down from $1.0 million for the prior quarter, and down from $1.8 million for the third quarter 2013. Net loan losses charged against the allowance for loan losses totaled $1.2 million for the third quarter 2014, compared to $711 thousand for the prior quarter and $810 thousand for the third quarter 2013. The increase in net loan losses in the third quarter 2014 is due to the charge-off of one nonaccrual loan. At September 30, 2014, the allowance for loan losses totaled $31.8 million; nonperforming originated loans totaled $5.1 million; and nonperforming purchased loans totaled $13.7 million, net of purchase discounts of $298 thousand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noninterest income for the third quarter 2014 totaled $13.1 million, compared to $13.2 million for the prior quarter and $14.4 million for the third quarter 2013. Noninterest income was higher in the third quarter 2013 due to higher merchant processing service fees, higher service charges on deposit accounts, and higher loan principal recoveries exceeding purchase date fair values (included in \u201cother noninterest income\u201d).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noninterest expense for the third quarter 2014 totaled $26.6 million, compared to $27.0 million in the prior quarter and $27.8 million for the third quarter 2013. Noninterest expense has declined due to lower OREO costs (net of gains on sale of repossessed loan collateral) and lower personnel costs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At September 30, 2014, Westamerica Bancorporation&#8217;s tangible common equity-to-asset ratio was 8.2 percent, assets totaled $5.0 billion and loans outstanding totaled $1.7 billion. Westamerica Bancorporation, through its wholly owned subsidiary Westamerica Bank, operates commercial banking and trust offices throughout Northern and Central California.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/3rdqfinhi14.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Quarterly Financial Highlights&nbsp;<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The following appears in accordance with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This press release may contain forward-looking statements about the Company, including descriptions of plans or objectives of its management for future operations, products or services, and forecasts of its revenues, earnings or other measures of economic performance.
