Operating expenses were $24.5 million for the fourth quarter 2020, representing only 43 percent of revenues on a fully-taxable equivalent basis.

Average total deposits grew $123 million from the third quarter 2020 to the fourth quarter 2020. Checking and savings deposits represented ninety-seven percent of the Company\u2019s average deposit base during the fourth quarter 2020 generating a 0.03 percent annualized cost of funding interest-earning assets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At December 31, 2020, nonperforming loans totaled $4.8 million and the allowance for credit losses on loans was $23.9 million. The Company continues to work with loan customers requesting deferral of loan payments due to economic weakness caused by the pandemic. At December 31, 2020, consumer loans granted loan deferrals totaled $2.5 million, commercial real estate loans with deferred payments totaled $7.8 million, primarily for hospitality, restaurant and retail properties, and commercial loans with deferred payments totaled $33 thousand. The commercial real estate loans with deferred payments are seasoned with low loan-to-value ratios.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noninterest income for the fourth quarter 2020 totaled $14.0 million, including a $3.5 million gain on sale of a closed branch building.
