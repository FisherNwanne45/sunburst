Credit quality improved with nonperforming assets declining to $18.1 million at June 30, 2016 from $26.4 million at March 31, 2016. Noninterest expenses declined $630 thousand from the first quarter 2016 to the second quarter 2016,\u201d said Chairman, President and CEO David Payne. \u201cWith stable revenues and reduced expenses, Westamerica delivered higher net income for our shareholders, generating an annualized return on shareholders\u2019 common equity of 11 percent for the second quarter 2016. Westamerica paid its shareholders a $0.39 per share dividend in the second quarter,\u201d concluded Payne.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The annualized net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 3.27 percent for the second quarter 2016, compared to 3.34 percent for the prior quarter, and 3.37 percent for the second quarter 2015. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $36.5 million for the second quarter 2016, compared to $36.4 million for the prior quarter, and $37.4 million for the second quarter 2015. The Company\u2019s loan portfolio has declined from the second quarter 2015 through the second quarter 2016; Management has been avoiding long-dated, low-yielding loans given historically low interest rates. Management has also maintained conservative loan underwriting, terms and conditions. During this period, the investment portfolio has grown. The changing composition of interest earning assets and low market interest rates has pressured the net interest margin. The funding cost of deposits and other interest-bearing borrowings, as a percentage of average loans and investment securities, was 0.05 percent for the second quarter 2016, unchanged from the prior quarter and down from 0.06 percent for the second quarter 2015.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The provision for loan losses was zero for the second quarter 2016, unchanged from the prior quarter and second quarter 2015. Net loan losses charged against the allowance for loan losses totaled $577 thousand for the second quarter 2016, compared to $284 thousand for the prior quarter and $359 thousand for the second quarter 2015. At June 30, 2016, the allowance for loan losses totaled $28.9 million and nonperforming loans totaled $13.9 million.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noninterest income for the second quarter 2016 totaled $11.7 million, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter, and compared to $12.3 million for the second quarter 2015.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noninterest expense for the second quarter 2016 totaled $25.2 million, compared to $25.9 million for the prior quarter, and $26.9 million for the second quarter 2015. Personnel costs were lower for the second quarter 2016 compared to the first quarter 2016 due to seasonally higher payroll taxes in the first quarter 2016. Personnel costs were lower for the second quarter 2016 compared to the second quarter 2015 due to lower insurance related costs. For the second quarter 2016, the cost of holding other real estate owned was offset by gains realized on the liquidation of properties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At June 30, 2016, Westamerica Bancorporation&#8217;s tangible common equity-to-asset ratio was 8.5 percent, and assets totaled $5.2 billion.
