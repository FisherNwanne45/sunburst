These results compare to net income of $19.6 million and EPS of $0.72 for the second quarter 2020 and net income of $20.4 million and EPS of $0.75 for the third quarter 2019. The third quarter 2019 results benefited from expense reducing FDIC insurance assessment credits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Westamerica is focusing on maintaining superior customer service during the pandemic. In keeping all our branches open, we are following all health orders affecting our business to provide a safe environment for our customers and employees. Westamerica\u2019s non-interest revenues improved $922 thousand in the third quarter 2020 compared to the prior quarter as economic activity showed some improvement. Net interest income on a fully-tax equivalent basis declined $283 thousand in the third quarter 2020 compared to the prior quarter due to low market interest rates. Operating expenses were $24.6 million for the third quarter 2020, representing only 47 percent of revenues on a fully-taxable equivalent basis. Credit quality remained stable with nonperforming loans of $4.7 million at September 30, 2020,\u201d said Chairman, President and CEO David Payne. \u201cThird quarter 2020 results generated an annualized 11.2 percent return on average common equity, and shareholders were paid a $0.41 per common share dividend during the quarter,\u201d concluded Payne.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Net interest income on a fully-taxable equivalent (FTE) basis was $41.8 million for the third quarter 2020, compared to $42.1 million for the second quarter 2020 and $40.3 million for the third quarter 2019. The annualized net interest margin (FTE) was 2.78 percent for the third quarter 2020, compared to 2.99 percent for the second quarter 2020 and 3.11 percent for the third quarter 2019. The decline in the margin is due to lower yields on interest-earning assets. Average total deposits grew $333 million from the second quarter 2020 to the third quarter 2020. Checking and savings deposits represented ninety-seven percent of the Company\u2019s average deposit base during the third quarter 2020 generating a 0.03 percent annualized cost of funding interest-earning assets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Company continues to work with loan customers requesting deferral of loan payments due to economic weakness caused by the pandemic. At September 30, 2020, consumer loans granted loan deferrals totaled $5.0 million, commercial real estate loans with deferred payments totaled $19.1 million, primarily for hospitality, restaurant and retail properties, and commercial loans with deferred payments totaled $209 thousand. The commercial real estate loans with deferred payments are seasoned with low loan-to-value ratios.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonperforming assets were $4.8 million at September 30, 2020. The Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses was $24.2 million at September 30, 2020. The Company recognized no provision for credit losses in the third quarter 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noninterest income for the third quarter 2020 totaled $10.5 million, compared to $9.6 million for the second quarter 2020; the increase is due to an improvement in merchant processing service fees and debit card fees. Noninterest income was $1.3 million lower for the third quarter 2020 compared to the third quarter 2019; the decrease is due to lower economic activity reducing activity-based fees related to deposit accounts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noninterest expense for the third quarter 2020 was $24.6 million compared to $24.8 million for the second quarter 2020 and $24.0 million for the third quarter 2019.
