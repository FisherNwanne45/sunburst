Risks include the lack of security controls for these devices, loss\/theft of devices, and the proliferation of mobile malware. Below are some helpful tips to help minimize the likelihood of a successful cyber-attack.<\/p>\n<h4>Regularly update your device.<\/h4>\n<p>Updated operating systems and security software are critical in protecting against emerging threats.<\/p>\n<h4>Use a passcode.<\/h4>\n<p>In case your phone ever does fall into the wrong hands, don\u2019t make it easy for someone to access all your important information! Enable strong password protection on your device and include a timeout requiring authentication after a period of inactivity. Secure the smartphone with a unique password &#8211; not the default one it came with. Do not share your password with others.<\/p>\n<h4>Do not use public Wi-Fi.<\/h4>\n<p>Do not log into accounts and do not conduct any sensitive transactions, such as shopping or banking, while using public Wi-Fi. Disable the \u201cautomatically connect to Wi-Fi\u201d setting on your device.<\/p>\n<h4>Install applications from trusted sources.<\/h4>\n<p>When downloading apps, be proactive and make sure that you read the privacy statement, review permissions, check the app reviews and look online to see if any security company has identified the app as malicious.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Install a phone locator\/remote erase app.<\/h4>\n<p>Misplacing your device doesn\u2019t have to be a catastrophe if it has a locater app. Many such apps allow you to log on to another computer and see on a map exactly where the device is. Remote erase apps allow you to remotely wipe data from your device, helping minimize unauthorized access to your information in the event you cannot locate the device.<\/p>\n<h4>Disable unwanted services when not in use.<\/h4>\n<p>Bluetooth and Near Field Capabilities (NFC) can provide an easy way for an unauthorized user nearby to gain access to your data. Turn these features off when they are not required.<\/p>\n<h4>Carefully dispose of mobile devices.<\/h4>\n<p>With the constant changes in the smartphone market, many users frequently upgrade to new devices. Make sure you wipe the information from your smartphone before disposal. For information on how to do this, check the website of your mobile provider or the manufacturer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>related resources<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><a href=\"\/business\/online-banking\/mobile-banking\/mobile-app\">Download Mobile App<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span><a href=\"\/business\/online-banking\/starid\">StarID Security Tokens<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mobile Banking Mobile Tips Negotiating security in the face of an ever-growing implementation of mobile devices presents serious challenges.
