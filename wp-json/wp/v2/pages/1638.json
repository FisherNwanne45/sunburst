Be sure to record all checks, debit card purchases, ATM withdrawals, account transfers, recurring bill payments and service fees as well as all direct deposits. Your checkbook register is a great tool to keep track of account transactions.<\/p>\n<h2>Know Your Account Balance<\/h2>\n<p>Keeping track of your balance is key to successfully managing your accounts. Here are some resources you can use to monitor your balances and avoid unnecessary fees:<\/p>\n<p><strong>24 Hour Telephone Banking<\/strong> \u2013 Your account information is just a phone call away.

Some accounts have the monthly service charge waived if you keep a designated minimum amount in your account. Also, by not letting your balance drop to low levels, there is a buffer in your account for emergencies or errors, helping you to prevent overdrafts.<\/p>\n<h2>Establish a Direct Deposit<\/h2>\n<p>Set up direct deposit of your payroll, social security, retirement or pension to have your income conveniently deposited into your account. You can make sure your account transactions are covered even if you don\u2019t have time to go to the bank.<\/p>\n<h2>Overdraft Protection Options<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Linked Overdraft Protection<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 With Linked Overdraft Protection, you designate a second Westamerica account to automatically transfer funds to your checking account if you don&#8217;t have enough money to cover a transaction.
