You will receive an email when your statement is ready. You then log into a secure website to view your eStatement and images of your cancelled checks. You have the option to save and\/or print your statement or check images.<\/p>\n<h4>What are the benefits of switching to eStatements?<\/h4>\n<p tve-droppable\"\"=\"\">By making the switch to eStatements, you can: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li tve-droppable\"\"=\"\">Access your statements 24 hours a day from anywhere you have internet access. <\/li>\n<li tve-droppable\"\"=\"\">Reduce the risk of mail fraud and identity theft that comes with paper delivery. <\/li>\n<li tve-droppable\"\"=\"\">Get organized and reduce the clutter of paper statements. <\/li>\n<li tve-droppable\"\"=\"\">Help to protect the environment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Will my eStatement look the same as my regular printed statement?<\/h4>\n<p>Yes, your eStatement is just the same as your paper statement and is considered an official document. It contains all the information from your paper statements, but includes the added convenience of images of your cancelled checks.<\/p>\n<h4>Are eStatements secure?<\/h4>\n<p>With eStatements, your personal and financial information are protected on a secure server, and the information can only be accessed with the authorized Login ID and password. When you are ready to leave the secure site, always log out to end your session.<\/p>\n<h4>How do I know if I am on a secure site?<\/h4>\n<p>Transport Layer Security (TSL) is used to access secure web pages. These pages use the prefix HTTPS, while regular web pages use HTTP. For example, when you view your eStatements you are viewing them from a secure site https:\/\/www.internet-estatements.com\/westamerica\/index.asp. The HTTPS prefix shows that the page you are viewing was encrypted before being transmitted over the Internet. Encryption makes it very difficult for an unauthorized individual to view information transferring between computers, according to VeriSign Trust Network, a certificate authority trusted for verifying the identity of websites.<\/p>\n<h4>If I have StarConnect Plus\u2122 or Onsite Banker Plus Online Banking, do I need to remember another ID and password to get eStatements?<\/h4>\n<p>No, StarConnect Plus and Onsite Banker Plus customers will log in to Online Banking using their existing ID and password. Once logged in you simply click on the &#8220;eStatements&#8221; link in the main menu for StarConnect Plus customers or the &#8220;Online Requests&#8221; tab of Onsite Banker Plus and select eStatements.<\/p>\n<h4>How do I view my eStatements?<\/h4>\n<p>After logging in, you will make a selection from: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A list of your enrolled checking and\/or savings accounts for which eStatements are available. <\/li>\n<li>If applicable, a list of Unviewed Documents available to be viewed for the first time. After you view a document listed in Unviewed Documents, the link no longer appears, however you can still access the document from your list of accounts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Should I log out of eStatements when I&#8217;m finished with my session?<\/h4>\n<p>Yes, when you are ready to leave the secure site, always click on the Log Out button to end your session.<\/p>\n<h4>What are the hardware and software requirements for eStatements?<\/h4>\n<p>To view, download, and\/or print eStatements, you will need a computer with an internet connection. Your internet browser must be current and you will need a current version of Adobe Acrobat Reader; if you do not have it, you can&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.adobe.com\/products\/acrobat\/readstep2.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">download Adobe Reader<\/a> for free.<\/p>\n<h4>How long will my eStatements be available for me to view?<\/h4>\n<p>Your eStatements are available to you for two years. For example, if your first eStatement is for the month of December 2014, you can continue to view that statement and any check images until December 2016. Each eStatement after your first will increase the \u201chistory\u201d of statements available to be viewed, until 24 months of statements have accumulated. You may choose to save your eStatements on your own computer system and store those files for as long as you like. Printed statements you received prior to switching to eStatements are not available to be viewed.<\/p>\n<h4>How will I know when a new eStatement is available?<\/h4>\n<p>We will send you an e-mail at the close of each statement cycle to let you know that your current statement is available. This will usually occur the day after your statement cycles. If you prefer NOT to receive an e-mail notice when your statement is ready, go to your eStatements Preferences to update your Delivery Options.<\/p>\n<h4>If I enroll a joint account in eStatements, will the other owner receive an e-mail notice when our statement is ready for viewing?<\/h4>\n<p>No. Each customer who enrolls in eStatements will receive an e-mail notice when a statement is ready. If you prefer NOT to receive an e-mail notice when your statement is ready, go to your eStatements Preferences to update your Delivery Options.<\/p>\n<h4>What if I change my e-mail address?<\/h4>\n<p>You\u2019ll be able to update your e-mail address by going to your eStatements Preferences. StarConnect Plus customers must update StarConnect Plus options by clicking on MyProfile. Regardless of which email address the notice is delivered to, you can still log in and view your statement.<\/p>\n<h4>If I sign up for eStatements, will I still receive my paper statements?<\/h4>\n<p>We discontinue your paper statements when you switch to eStatements. You can view, save, and print your eStatements at any time, and they are legally the same as a paper version mailed by us.
